This is the demo code used to run my GroovyFX/Griffon talk at Gr8Conf US.  This does not currently work out of the box because of a few bleeding edge bugs.  To run it locally....

Bleeding Edge Components, you will need to build these locally:
* [GroovyFX 0.3-SNAPSHOT](https://github.com/groovyfx-project/groovyfx)
* [Griffon GroovyFX plugin Version 0.7-SNAPSHOT](FIXME)
* [Griffon JavaFX plugin Version 0.7-SNAPSHOT](FIXME)
* [Griffon 1.1-SNAPSHOT](https://github.com/griffon/griffon/tree/1.1.x) - I can downgrade to 1.0.2 when shipped
